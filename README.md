Designed + built in a day. Focus on copy. Responsive w/ HiDPI SASS magic, courtesy of @Stammy's excellent article: http://paulstamatiou.com/responsive-retina-blog-development-part-2

Designed with a lot more interactivity, but I got lazy on the development after spending 4 hours figuring out HiDPI asset management. Learned lots, but it took the *umph* out of me for tis project. Will circle around in a few weekends once I've recharged elsewhere :)

Feel free to ask around on why certain things were done certain ways - I'm @pvm on Twitter.
